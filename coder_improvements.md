# Coder Skill Improvements

## Applied Changes

1. **Enhanced `apply_edit_blocks` error messages**
   - When a SEARCH block is not found, the tool now shows the first 500 characters of the file to help debugging.
   - Added a tip to use `read_code_file` for exact content.

2. **Added new tool `generate_unit_tests`**
   - Generates pytest unit tests for a given Python file using OpenAI.
   - Optional `function_name` parameter to focus on a specific function.
   - Returns generated test code as a formatted Python block.

3. **Refactored `add_missing_imports` function**
   - Split into helper functions to reduce cyclomatic complexity.
   - Improved maintainability and readability.

4. **Added TypeScript file analysis**
   - New internal function `_analyze_typescript_file` extracts functions, classes, interfaces, types, and enums.
   - Integrated into `investigate_and_save_report` for automatic analysis of `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

## Future Improvements (Suggested)

- Add `find_unused_imports` tool (using vulture or static analysis).
- Add `auto_import` tool to add missing imports.
- Improve `search_and_replace` with backup creation.
- Support for more languages (TypeScript, Java, C++).
- Add `extract_function` and `inline_variable` refactoring tools.
- Add `code_review` tool using AI.

## Testing

All existing tests pass.

## Usage

To use the new tool, load the coder skill and call `generate_unit_tests` with a file path.

Example:
```python
generate_unit_tests("/path/to/file.py", "my_function")
```

## Notes

The improvements are already applied to the source code. The skill needs to be reloaded for the changes to take effect (or restart the agent).
